# Write a program which prompts the user for an adjective, then a noun, then a verb, and then prints a fun sentence with those words!

# Mad Libs is a word game where players are prompted for one word at a time, and the words are eventually filled into the blanks of a word template to make an entertaining story! We've provided you with the beginning of a sentence (the SENTENCE_START constant) which will end in a user-inputted adjective, noun, and then verb.

# Here's a sample run (user input is in bold italics):

# Please type an adjective and press enter. tiny

# Please type a noun and press enter. plant

# Please type a verb and press enter. fly

# Code in Place is fun. I learned to program and used Python to make my tiny plant fly!



SENTENCE_START: str = "Panaversity is fun. I learned to program and used Python to make my" # adjective noun verb

# Function to play Mad Libs
def main():
    # Get the three inputs from the user to make the adlib
    adjective: str = input("🍦Please type an adjective and press enter. ")
    noun: str = input("👨Please type a noun and press enter. ")
    verb: str = input("🏃‍♂️Please type a verb and press enter. ")

    # Join the inputs together with the sentence starter
    print(f"\033[32m{SENTENCE_START} {adjective} {noun} {verb}❗\n\033[0m")

main()
